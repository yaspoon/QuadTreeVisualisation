QuadTreeTest Visualisation

Written by Brock York twunknown[replace with at]gmail.com

A simple quadtree implementation in C++ after following and adapting the code from this tutorial
http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-use-quadtrees-to-detect-likely-collisions-in-2d-space--gamedev-374

Running:
Linux:
See building the source

Windows:
Precompiled binary available here Win64 only at the moment:
https://github.com/yaspoon/QuadTreeVisualisation/blob/master/QuadTreeTest-Win64.zip?raw=true

Mac:
I don't own one so can't build for it.

Building from source:
Only builds on Linux until I learn how cmake/autotools works.
The Code::Blocks project can crosscompile for windows 64bit with mingw

Requirements:
SDL2
g++
Code::Blocks

Just open the QuadTreeTest.cbp project in Code::Blocks
and press f9 or build->run
